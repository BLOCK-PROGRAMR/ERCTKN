Project Overview


Voting Application is a decentralized voting platform built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity and React. This project leverages smart contracts to securely manage and record votes for two distinct candidates, YCP and TDP. The application is designed to offer a transparent and tamper-proof voting process, utilizing MetaMask for user authentication and interaction.



Key Features:

1.Smart Contract Integration: The voting logic is encapsulated in a Solidity smart contract, ensuring that votes are counted accurately and transparently.

2.User Authentication: MetaMask is used for secure and seamless user authentication and transaction signing.

3.Real-time Voting Results: Users can vote for their preferred candidate and view the real-time results, including the total votes, YCP votes, and TDP votes.

4.Responsive UI: The application features a user-friendly interface styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a professional and intuitive experience.



Technologies Used:


1.Solidity: For writing the smart contract that handles voting logic.

2.React: For building the frontend user interface.

3.Ethers.js: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.

4.Tailwind CSS: For designing a modern and responsive user interface.

5.MetaMask: For managing user accounts and signing transactions.

This project demonstrates the integration of blockchain technology with modern web development practices to create a robust and secure voting application.
